# Description of Final Project 

## Development of a Low-Cost Internet of Things Air Quality Monitoring System

An IoT-based indoor air quality monitoring system is demonstrated in this work, which consists of an air quality-sensing device and a cloud server. This platform uses the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technology to track indoor air quality in real-time
AQMS was created using IoT technology to effectively monitor air quality and transfer data to a cloud server in real-time. Microcontrollers and pollutant detecting sensors make up the device. The gadget was created for the study to monitor air quality by measuring smoke, CO, CO2, and temperature-humidity, as well as displaying the data on an OLED display module and pushing the data to both smartphone and computer.
