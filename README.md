## Problem Statement

The biggest environmental risk factor for human health is air pollution. Premature deaths and illnesses are caused by polluted air. For this reason, measuring air pollution can be a significant instrument for reducing exposure to air pollutants. This project aims to provide a low-cost air quality monitoring IoT device that analyses airborne pollution levels as well as temperature and humidity. Thereby, providing users with the ability to track the changes in air quality for their homes and facilities.
